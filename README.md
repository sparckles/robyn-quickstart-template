GitHub Codespaces ♥️ Robyn

Welcome to your shiny new Codespace running Robyn! We've got everything fired up and running for you to explore Robyn.

Everything you do here is contained within this one codespace. There is no repository on GitHub yet. If and when you’re ready you can click "Publish Branch" and we’ll create your repository and push up your project. If you were just exploring then and have no further need for this code then you can simply delete your codespace and it's gone forever.

To run this application:
```
python3 app.py
```
or

press `.` on keyboard to launch it on GitHub Codespaces
